## 🔭 About Me
I build pragmatic, production-focused web applications and internal tools. During my internship and part-time work (1.9 years during BTech) I led and implemented multiple systems used in real workplaces — from HRMS and inventory management to an LMS for STEM education. I enjoy working across the full stack, designing clean APIs, and shipping dependable features that help teams operate smoothly.
